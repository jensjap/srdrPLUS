This row is used in the extraction form of the SRDRPlus platform. In SRDRPlus, we first design the questions we want to extract and present them in the form of questions. These may include design details, arm details, outcome details, risk of bias assessment, etc. Each question may contain many sub-items that need to be answered, and some questions may be presented in the form of a table. When a table-based question appears, each table may have multiple rows, with each row may containing many columns.
