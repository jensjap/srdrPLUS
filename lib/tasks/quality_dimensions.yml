      question: "Random sequence generation (selection bias): Selection bias (biased allocation to interventions) due to inadequate generation of a randomized sequence"
      description: "There is a low risk of selection bias if the investigators describe a random component in the sequence  generation process such as: referring to a random number table, using a computer random number generator, coin tossing, shuffling cards or envelopes, throwing dice, drawing of lots, minimization  (minimization may be implemented without a random element, and this is considered to be equivalent to being random). There is a high risk of selection bias if the investigators describe a non-random component in the  sequence generation process, such as: sequence generated by odd or even date of birth, date (or day) of  admission, hospital or clinic record number; or allocation by judgement of the clinician, preference of  the participant, results of a laboratory test or a series of tests, or availability of the intervention."

      question: "Allocation concealment (selection bias): Selection bias (biased allocation to interventions) due to inadequate concealment of allocations prior to assignment"
      description: "There is a low risk of selection bias if the participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: central allocation (including telephone, web-based and pharmacy-controlled randomization); sequentially numbered drug containers of identical appearance; or sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. There is a high risk of bias if participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bias, such as allocation based on: using an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); assignment envelopes were used without appropriate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes were unsealed or non-opaque or not sequentially numbered); alternation or rotation; date of birth; case record number; or other explicitly unconcealed procedures."

      description: "There is a low risk of performance bias if blinding of participants and key studding personnel was ensured and it was unlikely that the blinding could have been broken; or if there was no blinding or incomplete blinding, but the review authors judge that the outcome is not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding."

      description: "There is low risk of detection bias if the blinding of the outcome assessment was ensured and it was unlikely that the blinding could have been broken; or if there was no blinding or incomplete blinding, but the review authors judge that the outcome is not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.; or: >> for patient-reported outcomes in which the patient was the outcome assessor (e.g., pain, disability): there is a low risk of bias for outcome assessors if there is a low risk of bias for participant blinding. >> for outcome criteria that are clinical or therapeutic events that will be determined by the interaction between patients and care providers (e.g., co-interventions, length of hospitalization, treatment failure), in which the care provider is the outcome assessor: there is a low risk of bias for outcome assessors if there is a low risk of bias for care providers. >> for outcome criteria that are assessed from data from medical forms: there is a low risk of bias if the treatment or adverse effects of the treatment could not be noticed in the extracted data."

      question: "Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias): Attrition bias due to amount, nature or handling of incomplete outcome data"
      description: "There is a low risk of attrition bias if there were no missing outcome data; reasons for missing outcome data were unlikely to be related to the true outcome (for survival data, censoring unlikely to be introducing bias); missing outcome data were balanced in numbers, with similar reasons for missing data across groups (The percentage of withdrawals and drop-outs should not exceed 20% for short-term follow-up and 30% for long-term follow-up and should not lead to substantial bias. Note: these percentages are commonly used but arbitrary, not supported by the literature); missing data were imputed using appropriate methods. For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with the observed event risk was not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate. For continuous outcome data, the plausible effect size (difference in means or standardized difference in means) among missing outcomes were not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on observed effect size. Note: if drop-outs are very large, imputation using even ‘acceptable’ methods may still suggest a high risk of bias."

      question: "Selective Reporting (reporting bias): Reporting bias due to selective outcome reporting"
      description: "There is low risk of reporting bias if the study protocol is available and all of the study’s pre-specified (primary and secondary) outcomes that are of interest in the review have been reported in the pre-specified way, or if the study protocol is not available but it is clear that the published reports include all expected outcome, including those that were pre-specified (convincing text of this nature may be uncommon). There is a high risk of reporting bias if not all of the study’s pre-specified primary outcomes have been reported; one or more primary outcomes is reported using measurements, analysis methods or subsets of the data (e.g. subscales) that were not pre-specified; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified (unless clear justification for their reporting is provided, such as an unexpected adverse effect); one or more outcomes of interest in the review are reported incompletely so that they cannot be entered in a meta-analysis; the study report fails to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a study."

      question: "Were the harms PRE-DEFINED using standardized or precise definitions"
      description: "Harms can be defined as the totality of adverse consequences of an intervention or therapy. Harms are the opposite of benefits, against which they are directly compared. The balance between the benefit(s) and harm(s) of an intervention (i.e. drug or surgery) is ideally used to determine its efficacy or effectiveness. Pre-defined indicates that the harms that were expected are explicitly defined prior to the collection of these expected events. For example, if bleeding is listed as a harmful event, the criteria by which they determine the bleeding (i.e. body location, type, or amount of blood loss that counts as an event, etc) should be specified. Standardized classification of harms can be derived from any of the following: 1) reference to standard terminology or classifications of harms from a recognized external organization(s)(such as government regulatory or health agencies. Examples of standardized terminology for harms includes, WHO-ART, MEDra, HTA report on the Measurement and Monitoring of Surgical Adverse Events); 2) previously explicitly defined classifications of harms in the literature, or; 3) based on pre-specified clinical criteria, or; 4) pre-specified laboratory test (may not need to have a specific cut-off level specified in all cases). In some instances only some of the harms identified in a study will be precisely defined. In this case, there must be some judgement if the nature of the harms not pre-defined."

Although the means by which author(s) attribute the reasons for withdrawal may not always be reproducible or free of bias, it is important that the total numbers of withdrawals are specified. 2) Loss to follow-up indicates participants that cannot be traced or contacted to determine important endpoints.

For example, how events may have been categorized, or how recurrent events were tabulated, or timing issues (repeated measures), or any statistical techniques in the analysis. Statistical analyses can include a variety of approaches. Typically, descriptive presentation of the harms events is shown and a comparison between groups (for example with a Fischers Exact Test, students t-test) is undertaken. More sophisticated analyses can include multivariate analyses (for example regression and survival analysis) that attempt to evaluate which factors predict the harms. This type of analysis is seen typically when the outcome of harm is one of the primary study outcomes. Often variables that have the potential to influence the occurrence of harms can be evaluated with covariate analysis. For example, covariates such as age and gender can be evaluated in such an analysis to detect their potential to act as confounders for the harms."

      question: "ALL.....Incomplete results data (attrition bias)"
      description: "There is a low risk of attrition bias if there were no missing outcome data; reasons for missing outcome data were unlikely to be related to the true outcome (for survival data, censoring unlikely to be introducing bias); missing outcome data were balanced in numbers, with similar reasons for missing data across groups (The percentage of withdrawals and drop-outs should not exceed 20% for short-term follow-up and 30% for long-term follow-up and should not lead to substantial bias. Note: these percentages are commonly used but arbitrary, not supported by the literature). For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with the observed event risk was not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate. For continuous outcome data, the plausible effect size (difference in means or standardized difference in means) among missing data were imputed using appropriate methods. Note: if drop-outs are very large, imputation using even ‘acceptable’ methods may still suggest a high risk of bias."

      description: "ALL (with AE results).....Passive ascertainment of harms occurs when study participants spontaneously report (on their own initiative) or are allowed to report harmful events not probed with active ascertainment. In some studies, laboratory or diagnostic tests are only ordered if a particular event is suspected. For example, a study participant is suspected of having a stroke based on clinical presentation; the authors would indicate that brain imaging tests would then be ordered to confirm the presence of absence of the stroke. In the situation where subjects are undergoing active surveillance (standardized questionnaires, or interviews, or diaries) there are opportunities for spontaneous reporting of unexpected harms."
