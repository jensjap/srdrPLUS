There is a high risk of bias if participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bias, such as allocation based on: using an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); assignment envelopes were used without appropriate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes were unsealed or non-opaque or not sequentially numbered); alternation or rotation; date of birth; case record number; or other explicitly unconcealed procedures."

Note: these percentages are commonly used but arbitrary, not supported by the literature); missing data were imputed using appropriate methods. For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with the observed event risk was not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate. For continuous outcome data, the plausible effect size (difference in means or standardized difference in means) among missing outcomes were not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on observed effect size.

For instance, use of a statistical method such as multiple imputation does not guarantee an appropriate answer.

          question: "7.2 ... multiple analyses of the intervention-outcome relationship?"
          description: "Because of the limitations of using data from non-randomized studies for analyses of effectiveness (need to control confounding, substantial missing data, etc), analysts may implement different analytic methods to address these limitations. Examples include unadjusted and adjusted models; use of final value vs change from baseline vs analysis of covariance; different transformations of variables; a continuously scaled outcome converted to categorical data with different cut-points; different sets of covariates used for adjustment; and different analytic strategies for dealing with missing data. Application of such methods generates multiple estimates of the effect of the intervention versus the comparator on the outcome. If the analyst does not pre-specify the methods to be applied, and multiple estimates are generated but only one or a subset is reported, there is a risk of selective reporting on the basis of results."

For example, if bleeding is listed as a harmful event, the criteria by which they determine the bleeding (i.e. body location, type, or amount of blood loss that counts as an event, etc) should be specified. Standardized classification of harms can be derived from any of the following: 1) reference to standard terminology or classifications of harms from a recognized external organization(s)(such as government regulatory or health agencies. Examples of standardized terminology for harms includes, WHO-ART, MEDra, HTA report on the Measurement and Monitoring of Surgical Adverse Events); 2) previously explicitly defined classifications of harms in the literature, or; 3) based on pre-specified clinical criteria, or; 4) pre-specified laboratory test (may not need to have a specific cut-off level specified in all cases).

Background indicates the professional or occupational designation of the person collecting the harms. For example, 1) physician, nurses, or other health professional, or 2) a study research assistant was specified as the background of the person who ascertained the presence or absence of the harm. In some studies it will indicate that the clinical data for the harm is sent to a clinical audit committee; typically the data sent concerns diagnostic or laboratory tests. In this instance we can assume that the committee was comprised of health professionals (likely physicians) who were adequately trained to determine the nature of the harms event."

Although the means by which author(s) attribute the reasons for withdrawal may not always be reproducible or free of bias, it is important that the total numbers of withdrawals are specified. 2) Loss to follow-up indicates participants that cannot be traced or contacted to determine important endpoints.

For example, how events may have been categorized, or how recurrent events were tabulated, or timing issues (repeated measures), or any statistical techniques in the analysis. Statistical analyses can include a variety of approaches. Typically, descriptive presentation of the harms events is shown and a comparison between groups (for example with a Fischers Exact Test, students t-test) is undertaken. More sophisticated analyses can include multivariate analyses (for example regression and survival analysis) that attempt to evaluate which factors predict the harms. This type of analysis is seen typically when the outcome of harm is one of the primary study outcomes. Often variables that have the potential to influence the occurrence of harms can be evaluated with covariate analysis. For example, covariates such as age and gender can be evaluated in such an analysis to detect their potential to act as confounders for the harms."

There is a high risk of bias if participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bias, such as allocation based on: using an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); assignment envelopes were used without appropriate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes were unsealed or non-opaque or not sequentially numbered); alternation or rotation; date of birth; case record number; or other explicitly unconcealed procedures."

Note: these percentages are commonly used but arbitrary, not supported by the literature). For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with the observed event risk was not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate. For continuous outcome data, the plausible effect size (difference in means or standardized difference in means) among missing data were imputed using appropriate methods. Note: if drop-outs are very large, imputation using even ‘acceptable’ methods may still suggest a high risk of bias."
