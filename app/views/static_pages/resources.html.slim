      p PROSPERO is an international prospective register of systematic reviews
        with health-related outcomes. PROSPERO was established to reduce unplanned
        duplication of reviews and provide transparency in the review process,
        with the aim of minimizing reporting bias.
      p PROSPERO accepts registration of systematic review protocols assessing interventions,
        diagnostic accuracy, prognostic factors, prevention, public health, service delivery as
        well as epidemiological and methodological reviews relevant to health and social care.
      p PROSPERO does not accept registrations for scoping reviews, literature reviews or those
        without an outcome of clear relevance to the health of humans. From 2019, submission must
        be made before data extraction has commenced. For further information on inclusion,
