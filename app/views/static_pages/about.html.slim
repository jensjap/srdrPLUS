  .grid-x.align-center
    .cell.small-6.In-an-effort-to-redu
      p In an effort to reduce the burden of conducting systematic reviews,
        researchers and developers at the Brown University Evidence-based
        Practice Center (EPC) (previously at Tufts Medical Center), with
        support from the <a href='https://www.ahrq.gov' target='_blank'>Agency for Healthcare
        Research and Quality (AHRQ)</a> developed a collaborative, Web-based
        repository of systematic review data. This resource serves as both
        an archive and data extraction tool and is shared among organizations
        and individuals producing systematic reviews worldwide, enabling the
        creation of a central database of systematic review data which may be
        critiqued, updated, and augmented on an ongoing basis. This database
        is freely accessible to facilitate evidence reviews and thus improve
        and speed up policy-making with regards to healthcare.
      p SRDR+ is an updated version of SRDR with a range of new features and
        improvements to the system. For a period of time, both SRDR and SRDR+
        will run in parallel. We will send out notifications so that you are
        prepared for the eventual migration of all projects from SRDR to SRDR+.

      h2.Why-have-an-open-sys Why have an open systematic review data repository?
      .Such-a-repository-he
        p Such a repository helps the world in various ways, such as through:
        ul
          li Improved access to data by consumers of systematic review evidence;
          li Promotion of transparency and reliability in the systematic review
            process via communal review;
          li Enhanced cooperation and utilization across related resources
            (such as <a href='https://clinicaltrials.gov' target='_blank'>ClinicalTrials.gov</a>);
          li More efficient means of producing and updating systematic reviews; and
          li Facilitation of other novel avenues of inquiry, such as those
            investigating research methodology (e.g., comparing different types of
            outcomes across disciplines, or comparing methodological quality of
            studies based on funding sources) by concentrating relevant data into
            one readily available resource.
