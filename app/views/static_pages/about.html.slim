  h2 About the Systematic Review Data Repository Plus&trade; (SRDR+)
  p In an effort to reduce the burden of conducting systematic reviews,
    researchers and developers at the Brown University Evidence-based
    Practice Center (EPC) (previously at Tufts Medical Center), with
    support from the <a href='https://www.ahrq.gov' target='_blank'>Agency for Healthcare
    Research and Quality (AHRQ)</a> developed a collaborative, Web-based
    repository of systematic review data. This resource serves as both
    an archive and data extraction tool and is shared among organizations
    and individuals producing systematic reviews worldwide, enabling the
    creation of a central database of systematic review data which may be
    critiqued, updated, and augmented on an ongoing basis. This database
    is freely accessible to facilitate evidence reviews and thus improve
    and speed up policy-making with regards to healthcare.
  p SRDR+ is an updated version of SRDR with a range of new features and
    improvements to the system. For a period of time, both SRDR and SRDR+
    will run in parallel. We will send out notifications so that you are
    prepared for the eventual migration of all projects from SRDR to SRDR+.

  h2 Why have an open systematic review data repository?
  p Such a repository helps the world in various ways, such as through:
  ul
    li Improved access to data by consumers of systematic review evidence;
    li Promotion of transparency and reliability in the systematic review
      process via communal review;
    li Enhanced cooperation and utilization across related resources
      (such as <a href='https://clinicaltrials.gov' target='_blank'>ClinicalTrials.gov</a>);
    li More efficient means of producing and updating systematic reviews; and
    li Facilitation of other novel avenues of inquiry, such as those
      investigating research methodology (e.g., comparing different types of
      outcomes across disciplines, or comparing methodological quality of
      studies based on funding sources) by concentrating relevant data into
      one readily available resource.
