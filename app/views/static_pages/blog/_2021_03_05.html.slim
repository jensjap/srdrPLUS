        p Supported by AHRQ, the #{ link_to('Systematic Review Data Repository Plus (SRDR+)', root_url) } is working towards eventually becoming the first FHIR-enabled platform for conducting and sharing the results of systematic reviews. As part of this work, handling citations of included studies in systematic reviews just got easier!

        p Study-related citation information (author names, article titles, page numbers, and other identifying information) is crucial for identifying studies and referencing them in systematic review reports.

        p Once researchers are ready to screen and extract data from eligible studies, they must first import their citations into platforms, such as SRDR+. Citation files can take the form of a variety of file formats.

        p For the purposes of screening and subsequent data extraction, SRDR+ is now capable of importing citations saved in the following file formats: Research Information Systems (.ris), comma-separated values (.csv), a list of PubMed IDs (.txt), EndNote file (.enw), and the newly supported, HL7 FHIR file format.

        p The HL7 FHIR file format is a brand new standard, developed by the #{ link_to('HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) endeavor', 'https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html', target: '_blank', data: { confirm: @exit_disclaimer }) }, which defines how healthcare information can be exchanged #{ link_to('between', 'https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/2019-08/ONCFHIRFSWhatIsFHIR.pdf', target: '_blank', data: { confirm: @exit_disclaimer }) } different computer systems regardless of how the information is stored within those systems. Furthermore, healthcare information saved in the HL7 FHIR file format is secured in such a way that only those with a need and assigned privileges to access the information are allowed to.

        p We anticipate that the HL7 FHIR file format will eventually become widespread in the field of evidence synthesis.

        p #{ link_to('PICO Portal', 'https://picoportal.org/', target: '_blank', data: { confirm: @exit_disclaimer }) } is an example of a systematic review platform that is now supporting the HL7 FHIR file format. SRDR+ users will be happy to know that they can now seamlessly import citation data from such platforms directly into SRDR+, where they can then continue working on their systematic reviews.

        p Give it a shot! Try importing citations using the HL7 FHIR file format and let us know how it’s going.
