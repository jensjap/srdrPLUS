        | SR of nonsurgical interventions for stress, urgency, and mixed urinary incontinence in women (excluding
          neuropathic UI and children). Network meta-analysis of "urinary incontinence outcomes" ("cure", improvement,
          and satisfaction with the level of incontinence achieved). Qualitative review of quality of life outcomes.
          Summary of adverse events. This is an update of a 2012 review done by the Minnesota EPC. Available data from
          eligible studies included in the prior review are uploaded as separate files.

        | Objectives: This review updates previous reviews regarding the optimal risk stratification tools for stroke
          and bleeding prediction and treatment options for stroke prevention. Data Sources: We searched PubMed®,
          Embase®, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for relevant English-language comparative studies
          published from January 1, 2000, to February 14, 2018. Review Methods: Two investigators screened each abstract
          and full-text article for inclusion, abstracted data, rated quality and applicability, and graded evidence.
          When possible, random-effects models were used to compute summary estimates of effects.

        b> Description:
        | The objectives of this database are to: 1. Systematically compile and provide access to primary, English-language,
          peer-reviewed science linking dietary fiber intake in humans to one or more of 10 potential health benefits 2.
          Provvide researchers with a tool to understand how different fibers are characterized in studies 3. Facilitate
          researchers in identifying gaps in the current research 4. Create a database to serve as a starting foundation of
          primary human literature for conducting evidence-based reviews and meta-analyses 5. Efficiently assist researchers
          in identifying fibers of interest. This database should serve as a foundation for future work. Specific inclusion
          and exclusion criteria, detailed in the user manual, were applied in determining database eligibility; thus, this
          database is not intended to serve as a sole source for identifying all possible fiber literature for the purposes
          of conducting a meta-analysis or systematic review. This database contains Population, Intervention, Comparator,
          and Outcome (PICO) data to help users formulate and narrow the focus of their research question. It is expected
          that secondary searches will be conducted to augment this database.
