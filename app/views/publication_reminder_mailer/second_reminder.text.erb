Good afternoon,

Thank you for using the Systematic Review Data Repository Plus (SRDR+) for data extraction in your project! An important function of SRDR+ is to serve as an open-access repository of systematic review data.

Your SRDR+ project entitled "<%= @project.name %>" appears to have been last updated more than 6 months ago. If your project is complete, we strongly encourage you to make data from your project public. When you are ready, please submit a Publication Request using the Publish button located to the far right on your Project Navigation Toolbar.

After you have completed this step, please email me (bryant_smith@brown.edu) I will review your project for publication.

Once published, the extracted data in your project will be accessible to all visitors to the SRDR+ Published Projects page [link: https://srdrplus.ahrq.gov/published_projects/]. As a reminder, visitors will be able to view and download your project data but will not be able to edit your project. We also encourage you to include the link to your published project in your journal and other publications.

We are very grateful to you for helping realize one of the key parts of the vision behind SRDR+ (as a repository of systematic review data).

Please let me know of any questions.

Thanks,
Bryant Smith
SRDR Administrator
