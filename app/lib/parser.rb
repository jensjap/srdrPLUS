    " Based on feedback from a stakeholder panel, this update focuses on the comparative benefits and harms of nonsurgical treatments, both nonpharmacological and pharmacological." +
    " Based on input from clinicians and nurses who treate women with UI, patient advocates, and articles found from our primary and grey literature searches, cure (or complete resolution) of UI symptoms (incontinence, urgency, and frequency), rather than cure of UI itself, is highest priority for most women with UI." +
    " The Patient-Centered Research Outcomes Institute (PCORI) held a multi-stakeholder virtual workshop on December 7, 2016, to discuss potential scoping for the updated review, including the prioritization of key questions (KQ), a discussion of where the evidence base has accumulated since the prior review, and emerging issues of importance to the field. Stakeholders included patients, clinicians and allied health professionals, professional organizations, research funders, payers, and industry. The full participant list, presentation slides from the meeting, and an audio recording of the entire discussion can be found at the PCORI Web site (http://www.pcori.org/events/2016/updating-systematic-reviews-pcori-virtual-multi-stakeholder- workshop-nonsurgical).    Stakeholders agreed that the questions regarding treatment of UI still represented critical issues. Several specific interventions were brought up during the meeting as important for the review to address. These included (1) mirabegron, (2) Impressa®, a vaginal insert manufactured by Poise®, (3) onabotulinum toxin A (BTX) injections, (4) nerve stimulation interventions, and (5) “lifestyle” interventions (e.g., bladder irritant reductions, fluid management).    Stakeholders were particularly interested in treatment effectiveness in specific patient populations. These included (1) women athletes and those engaging in high-impact physical activity, (2) older women, (3) military women or veterans, and (4) racial and ethnic minorities.    Based on stakeholder input, the 2012 AHRQ review Key Question (KQ) 1 on the diagnostic evaluation of UI was deemed to be of lower priority for updating at this time. Stakeholders also noted that it is important to summarize information on how patients define successful treatment." +
    " Stakeholders, including Key Informants and Technical Experts, participated in a virtual workshop by the Patient-Centered Research Outcomes Institute (PCORI) in December 2016 to help formulate the research protocol. Details on the virtual workshop, including a list of participants, can be found at https://www.pcori.org/events/2016/updating-systematic-reviews- pcori-virtual-multi-stakeholder-workshop-nonsurgical.    Key Informants in the workshop included end users of research, such as patients and caregivers, practicing clinicians, relevant professional and consumer organizations, purchasers of health care, and others with experience in making health care decisions. Technical Experts in the workshop included multidisciplinary groups of clinical, content, and methodological experts who provided input in defining populations, interventions, comparisons, and outcomes and identified particular studies or databases to search. They were selected to provide broad expertise and perspectives specific to the topic under development.    During the virtual workshop, stakeholders reviewed scoping for the updated review, prioritized key questions, and discussed where the evidence base has accumulated since the prior review and emerging issues in urinary incontinence. A protocol on nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatments of urinary incontinence was developed based upon findings from the workshop.    Key Informants and Technical Experts do not do analysis of any kind nor do they contribute to the writing of the report. They have not reviewed the report, except as given the opportunity to do so through the peer or public review mechanisms."

Although not listed a priori in the 2012 AHRQ review, calcium channel blockers and resiniferatoxin (a TRPV1 antagonist) were included in the original review.

The large majority (83%) of studies were deemed to be of low risk of bias; therefore, for each conclusion, the evidence base usually had low risk of bias. Exceptions included the effect of neuromodulation versus no treatment on quality of life and most of the conclusions regarding adverse events, which were generally poorly and inconsistently reported. For most analyses studies reported consistent results regarding the comparative effectiveness of interventions or the risk of adverse events.  The primary exception related to quality of life, for which studies reported some inconsistent results both within and across studies.  Given the extremely large number of possible comparisons among both intervention categories and specific interventions, we provide strength of evidence ratings only for those comparisons for which summary conslusions are possible.  In most instances where comparative effectiveness estimates were imprecise, no conclusions are possible, and these comparisons are omitted.  However, where feasible, conclusions were made for quality of life and adverse event outcomes despite some instances of imprecision mostly due to sparse data.  For the UI outcomes, directness was summarized as variable.  The directness metric covers various concepts including whether the conclusions are based on direct (head-to-head comparisons) and whether the reported outcomes are direct (true) measures of the outcome of interest.  For all UI outcomes, the conclusions are based on both direct and indirect evidence, per the network meta-analysis.  As noted, all network and direct comparisons were congruent and were consistent between the networks of all studies and of the subsets of stress or urgency UI, so the overall strength of evidence was not downgraded due to indirectness.  Although there was some variability in the definitions of cure improvement, and satisfaction, these were deemed to be sufficiently minor to not affect the overall directness.  In contrast, some adverse event conclusions were downgraded for being indirect in that the outcomes (\"any,\" \"moderate,\" or\"severe\"adverse events) were generally not defined and likely varied across studies.",

Study-level details, including citations, are presented in Appendix E.",
      "Nonpharmacological Interventions Versus Sham or No Treatment\nFifteen nonpharmacological interventions (including combinations of interventions) were\ncompared with sham or no treatments in 36 studies (Table 15). Twenty-three of these studies\nevaluated behavioral interventions, which included bladder training, education, PFMT,\nbiofeedback, electroacupuncture, weight loss, and yoga, and combinations of these interventions, 35, 49, 52, 53, 56, 69, 93, 98, 103, 109, 111, 117, 119-121, 125, 127, 134, 137, 142, 147, 148, 150, 155, 156, 162-165, 167-169 three\ncombinations of behavioral and neuromodulation,28, 43, 162 and one an intravesical pressure release device.63 The studies mostly analyzed daily activity, bother, general health, and mental health.\nAcross interventions, the effect of the nonpharmacological interventions on various aspects of quality of life was mixed. Among interventions compared by more than one study, only TENS (alone) was found by all studies to be statistically significantly better than sham for any specific aspect of quality of life. TENS alone was found to result in better mental health quality of life (2 studies).35, 93 All interventions evaluated by more than one study were found to have a statistically significant improvement in at least one aspect of quality of life by at least one study, except for PFMT, in which only discordant or nonsignificant results were found in daily activities and general health. Only two interventions for which any aspect of quality of life was evaluated were not found to result in better quality of life than sham: combined bladder training and PFMT, and the intravesical pressure release device. However, the data for these interventions were sparse. The two studies evaluating these two interventions each reported on only a single aspect of quality of life.",
      "Nonpharmacological Interventions Versus Other Nonpharmacological Interventions\nNineteen nonpharmacological interventions (including combinations of interventions) were\ncompared with other active interventions (Table 16). Forty-two studies evaluated behavioral\ninterventions versus other behavioral interventions (or combinations of behavioral interventions),\nincluding bladder training, education, PFMT, biofeedback, electroacupuncture, weight loss, and yoga. 31, 46, 51, 66, 74, 108, 115-118, 122-124, 126, 128-133, 135, 136, 138-141, 143-146, 149, 151-153, 157-162, 166, 170 One study evaluated\nneuromodulation (electric stimulation) versus behavioral therapy,35 and ten evaluated combinations of behavioral therapy and neuromodulation versus behavioral therapy alone. 31, 66, 108, 116, 117, 136, 138, 159, 162 These studies mostly analyzed bother, daily activities, distress, general health, mental health, and sexual health.\nFew interventions were compared by more than one study, and these contrasts generally were split\nbetween discordant or nonsignificant findings when analyzing bother, daily activities, or general health.\nSupervised PFMT was found to improve quality of life statistically significantly more than unsupervised\nPFMT or other specific types of exercise or physical therapy in one study for bother and in two studies\neach for the domains of daily activities and mental health. The other studies evaluating these\ncomparisons reported discordant or nonsignificant differences between the interventions.46, 51, 74, 117, 118, 123, 124, 126, 128-130, 133, 139, 141, 146, 149, 152, 153, 157, 170\nOne study reported statistically significant improvements in the daily activities domain with PFMT and biofeedback compared with PFMT alone, and one study reported significant improvements in distress for bladder training combined with PFMT and biofeedback when compared to bladder training alone or PFMT with biofeedback117, 166 However, nine studies either reported discordant or nonsignificant differences across all other domains for this comparison.35, 74, 124, 128, 129, 131, 133, 138, 149\nAdditionally, two studies found significant improvements among the control groups for two outcomes; bladder training alone was found to have significant improvements in bother ratings over combined TENS, PFMT, and biofeedback, and electroacupuncture alone was found to have significant improvements when compared to PFMT with weights in assessing impact on daily activities.108, 131",
      "Adverse Events\nFifty-two studies reported on adverse events in studies of nonpharmacological interventions.14, 29, 32, 46, 54, 60, 69, 92, 95, 98, 109, 115, 119, 120, 123, 126, 128, 129, 132, 133, 136, 138, 140, 144, 147, 149, 150, 154, 156, 157, 160, 161, 165, 168, 169, 171-\n187 The results are presented in Tables 17 and 18 (parts 1 and 2, respectively). For adverse events that were reported only by a single study (arm), the table cells show the percentage of people affected by the adverse event. Where more than one study arm reported on an adverse event, the cell gives the median and range of percentages (or just the range, if only two arms reported an adverse event). Detailed results are in Appendix F.\nIn general, the percentages of women with adverse events were low, but reporting was sparse with only one or two studies reporting adverse events for most of the interventions. No specific adverse event (e.g., urinary tract infection, diarrhea, dry mouth) was reported in more than one study for any specific intervention (e.g., acupuncture, bladder support). The most commonly reported adverse event was the group nonmajor or undefined adverse event. In two studies of bladder training, four studies of education, and two of three studies of magnetic stimulation (with 76 women), no adverse events were reported. The other study of magnetic stimulation reported that 3 of 60 women (5%) had an undefined adverse event. In two studies of InterStimTM (a form of sacral neuromodulation), 1 of 284 women total (0.4%) had a “serious” adverse event (an implant site erosion). In two studies of electroacupuncture (287 women) one reported no adverse events in 24 women, the other reported four adverse events in 247 women. A small study of bladder support (29 women) reported no adverse events.\nAmong 13 studies of TENS, nine reported no adverse events in 571 women, but two reported any or any moderate adverse event in a total of 13 of 67 women (19%). Overall, adverse events were reported in 2.8 percent of 463 women receiving TENS. In three studies of TENS, 11 percent of women (n = 199) reported urinary tract infections; however, within studies, these rates were similar to or lower than urinary tract infection rates on an anticholinergic (6%) or with BTX (35%).",
      "Quality of Life\nSixteen RCTs reported on quality of life outcomes in pharmacological interventions versus placebo or with other pharmacological interventions.38, 45, 62, 70, 84, 96, 114, 117, 188-195 Results are given in Table 20 and Appendix E. The table cells show the number of studies and the number of people (in parentheses), followed by the number of studies with the number of studies that found statistically significant differences and which intervention was favored, the number of studies that found discordant results (that is, within the same study, significant differences favoring one intervention were found on one scale or subscale, but nonsignificant differences were found on others), and the number of studies with nonsignificant differences. Study-level details are given in Appendix E. The studies evaluated several quality of life domains, as categorized across the columns of the tables: bother, daily activities, distress, general health, mental health, and sleep/energy.\nEight pharmacological interventions were compared with placebo interventions (Table 20). Six studies evaluated anticholinergic medications,114, 117, 190, 191, 193-195 two bladder BTX,45, 190 and one each an alpha agonist,84,an antiepileptic (pregabalin),192 and a periurethral bulking agent.38 Across interventions, the effects of the pharmacological interventions on various aspects of quality of life were mixed. Only two specific interventions (oxybutynin and tolterodine) were compared in more than one study, and none in more than two.\nWhen anticholinergic medications were evaluated as a single group, four studies evaluated bother,114, 117, 191, 194 and four studies evaluated daily activities.114, 117, 193, 195 When these studies were significant they favored the anticholinergic medication over placebo,114, 193 though most were not significant and one gave discordant results.195",
      "Adverse Events\nNinety-five studies reported on adverse events in drugs.29, 32, 34, 38, 39, 45, 46, 54, 57-61, 68-70, 76, 78, 82- 84, 88, 89, 91, 94, 96, 98, 99, 101, 105, 106, 109, 112, 120, 147, 154, 160, 165, 168, 171-173, 188-192, 194, 196-242 Results for\nanticholinergics are given in Table 22, and results for all other drugs, as well as for placebo arms (56 studies14, 32, 38, 39, 45, 54, 57-59, 61, 68, 69, 76, 78, 83, 84, 88, 89, 91, 92, 94, 98, 99, 101, 105, 106, 109, 112, 120, 147, 154, 160,\n165, 168, 172, 173, 190-192, 194, 202, 204, 207-211, 214, 218, 219, 222, 230, 233, 237, 238, 242), are given in Table 23. The\ntable cells show the percentage of people affected by the adverse event if only a single study arm\nreported the event. Where more than one study arm reported on an adverse event, the cell gives\nthe median and range of percentages (or just the range, if only two arms reported an adverse\nevent). Detailed results are in Appendix F. Fifty-one studies evaluated adverse events in anticholinergics,32, 34, 39, 46, 58, 60, 61, 68, 70, 88, 94, 96, 105, 112, 188-192, 194, 196-199, 201-203, 205, 206, 209-211, 213, 215-\n218, 220-222, 229, 231-234, 236-238, 240-242 but with the exception of oxybutynin and tolterodine, each specific adverse event was evaluated in only one to three studies.\nFor most pharmacological interventions, serious adverse events (as described by authors) were rare or did not occur; although few studies defined serious adverse events. However, with periurethral bulking agents, 4.7 percent of 362 women in three studies had serious adverse events, including erosion and need for surgical excision of the bulking agents. The one study of a periurethral bulking agent currently available in the United States (macroplastique) reported 1.6% rate of erosion. In eight studies of anticholinergics, overall 2.4 percent of 2,583 women had serious adverse events, although the adverse events were mostly undefined. In two studies, 0.6 percent of 1,390 women taking the alpha agonist duloxetine had (undefined) serious adverse events. By comparison, in 10 studies, 0.2 percent of 2,852 women taking placebo (or no treatment) had (mostly undefined) serious adverse events.\nThe most commonly reported adverse event across interventions was dry mouth. The median\npercentage of women reporting dry mouth in studies of anticholinergic medications was 24.2\npercent; oxybutynin was evaluated in the most studies (21) with a median of 36.1 percent (range 0 to 100).32, 34, 39, 58, 68, 105, 189, 190, 196, 198, 199, 201, 206, 215, 229, 232, 234, 238, 240, 242-244 A single study each\nevaluated dry mouth in beta agonist (0.7%),200 BTX (30.8%),70 estrogen (21.4%),243 and antiepileptic medications (10.5%).192 Fifteen studies evaluated dry mouth for duloxetine, an\nalpha agonist, and found a median of 12.9 percent (range 1.5 to 21.8). Placebo arms had a median of 4 percent across 29 studies (range 0 to 86.2).32, 39, 57-59, 61, 68, 76, 83, 84, 89, 91, 99, 101, 105, 106,\n190, 192, 204, 208-210, 214, 219, 222, 233, 238, 242 By comparison, in non-pharmaceutical treatments including PFMT and/or bladder training, dry mouth was reported in three studies with median rates that ranged from 0 to 34.9 percent.32, 179, 245\nAmong the other active drugs (see Table 23), duloxetine, an alpha agonist, was evaluated in the largest number of studies (16).57, 59, 76, 83, 84, 89, 91, 99, 101, 106, 204, 208, 214, 219, 224, 230 In addition to\ndry mouth, discussed above, dizziness (10.6% 14 studies), gastrointestinal upset, specifically constipation (11%; 14 studies) and nausea (23.2%; 15 studies), fatigue (8.6%, 12 studies), headache (8.3%; 11 studies), and insomnia (12.6%; 13 studies) were all reported in more than ten studies.\nOnly six studies reported on adverse events in bladder BTX.29, 45, 70, 78, 207, 227 Five reported on urinary tract infections (UTI). The percentage of women reporting UTI ranged from 33.3 to 42.9 percent in the four studies with at least 20 participants (6/11 or 55% in the fifth study), with a median of 36.4 percent.29, 45, 70, 78, 207, 227 This compares to a reported percentage of 1.5 percent for mirabegron, between 1.4 and 23 percent for various anticholinergics, and 4.3 percent in placebo arms. The sixth study reported hematuria in 2.3 percent of women using bladder BTX.29, 45, 70, 78,\n207, 227 Two studies reported on urine retention/voiding dysfunction in10.5 and 20.5 percent of women.29, 45, 70, 78, 207, 227\nThe most commonly reported adverse event for the periurethral bulking agents was UTI in five studies (median 6.6%; range 1.3% to 23.8%)38, 223, 225, 226, 235 and urinary retention/voiding dysfunction in seven studies (median 3.8%; range 0.9% to 9.5%).38, 212, 223, 225, 228, 235, 239. However, only one of these studies (122 women) evaluated a periurethral bulking agent currently available in the United States (macroplastique). This study found high rates of urinary tract infection (23.8%), headache (18%), and urinary retention/dysuria (15.6%). Serious adverse events (erosion) were low (1.6%), as were pain (5%) and yeast infection (2.5%).38 All other single and combination medications were evaluated in only one or two studies each.",
      "Four RCTs reported on quality of life outcomes in nonpharmacological interventions versus pharmacological interventions, one for each comparison against oxybutynin, trospium, and BTX; the remaining two RCTs reported comparisons against tolterodine.29, 46, 60, 117 Results are given in Table 24 and Appendix E. The table cells show the number of studies and the number of people (in parentheses), followed by the number of studies with the number of studies that found statistically significant differences and which intervention was favored, the number of studies that found discordant results (that is, within the same study, significant differences favoring one intervention were found on one scale or subscale, but nonsignificant differences were found on others), and the number of studies with nonsignificant differences. No significant differences",
      "Quality of Life\nA single study of 69 people reported on quality of life in combined pharmacological and nonpharmacological versus nonpharmacological only.177 Both arms received PFMT, electrostimulation, and biofeedback, but one arm also received vaginal estrogen. The arm that received estrogen did significantly better on the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ-7), with a net difference of -7.8 (95% CI -9.6 to -6) on the 100-point scale.",
      "Adverse Events\nRates of adverse events from combined interventions are presented in Table 26. Each adverse event was reported in only a single study. Detailed results are in Appendix F. One study reported on a combination of PFMT and the anticholinergic medication trospium, but reported only on three adverse events in 31 people.179 In this study low percentages of women reported visual adverse events (3.2%) and discontinuation due to adverse events (3.2%), but more reported dry mouth (23%).179 Four studies reported on adverse events from estrogen combined with PFMT, pessaries, and/or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS).82, 171, 177, 224 Each adverse event was evaluated by only a single study, but the percentage of women reporting these adverse events were below 4 percent."
