  #!!! We can't implement this without ensuring integrity of the extraction form. It is possible that the database
  #    is rendered inconsistent if a project lead changes links between type1 and type2 after this hook is called.
  #    We need something that ensures consistency when linking is changed.
  #
  # Note: 6/25/2018 - We call ensure_extraction_form_structure in work and consolidate action. this might be enough
  #                   to ensure consistency?
